# OpenSourcedMacroModels

Working paper describing the content below, and more: [SSRN version](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4755247), [IFC Bulletin version](https://www.bis.org/ifc/publ/ifcb64_17_rh.pdf).

## Objective
The goal of this repository is to collect in one place the open-sourced macroeconomic models, in particular (but not limited to) those used by central banks, ministries of finance and other offical sector agencies.

If you know a model that is not listed here, please open up a pull request [here](https://github.com/dkgaraujo/OpenSourcedMacroModels/pulls). PRs for corrections are also very welcome. Alternatively, feel free to reach out to me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/DouglasKGAraujo).

## Other related resources

Below are other resources that are worth consulting for their wealth of model code. The table below lists policy models open sourced by entities not in the official sector. Other sources are listed after the table.

But more effective is to create a country-specific calibration that uses `OG-Core` as a dependency (e.g., [`OG-USA`](https://github.com/PSLmodels/OG-USA) and [`OG-UK`](https://github.com/PSLmodels/OG-UK)). [`OG-Core` documentation](https://pslmodels.github.io/OG-Core/) is thorough and up-to-date. |

Large-scale overlapping generations model of U.K. fiscal policy. It uses as a dependency the [`OG-Core`](https://github.com/PSLmodels/OG-Core) model logic and interfaces with the [`OpenFisca-UK`](https://policyengine.github.io/openfisca-uk/) open-source microsimulation model. [`OG-UK` documentation](https://pslmodels.github.io/OG-UK/) is also under development. |

It uses as a dependency the [`OG-Core`](https://github.com/PSLmodels/OG-Core) model. `OG-USA` is currently set up to inteface with the open-source [`Tax-Calculator`](https://github.com/PSLmodels/Tax-Calculator) microsimulation model. However, it has been used with other microsimulation models as well (e.g., Tax Policy Center microsimulation model). [`OG-USA` documentation](https://pslmodels.github.io/OG-USA/) is thorough and up-to-date. |
